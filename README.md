# Random word

a random word guessing game on your CLI app

## Setup

To be able to play this game you can download its [zip](https://github.com/ShimejiAnna4191/Random-word/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and then extract it to your repo
After dowload and extracted it, you can run the program through gcc, since this is C++ I recommend you use g++ and run with the following command

On window

You have the option to extract the file anywhere, for example I extracted the file at `C:\Users\nameuser\` then run command

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\nameuser\Random-word-main\main\" && g++ main.cpp -o3 main
```

Or you can find the location of the file you extracted and go to **main** floder then right-click then click `run in terminal` or pess `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open terminal then just `g++ main.cpp -o3 main` to run

On linux

it is default in home folder so you just extracted it then run command

```bash
cd "/Random-word-main/main/" && g++ main.cpp -o3 main
```

## Beside

If you use some environment for C/C++ like DevC/C++ or then you just need to open the file and run them because they have built-in compiler support

If you use vscode then you need to download [gcc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) for vscode then run it

If you use a Vim environment like Vi, Vim or Neovim then just follow the **setup**, make sure you have navigated correctly and have gcc in clang

In case of linux you can do the same as Windows if you download the [raphical user interface package](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK) and configure it
